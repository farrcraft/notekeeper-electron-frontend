Build an MVP product using the existing framework we've built to date.
We could just call it NoteKeeper.io - Lite Edition later on if we want.

Make it a cheap 1 time purchase per platform group, e.g. $5.
Platform groups are desktop (macOS, Linux, Windows), ioS, Android.

A purchase gets you a license to any single one of the 3 platform groups.
The license is good forever for the life of this product edition.

The product is a standalone application.
No syncing or online features.
There is just a single notebook.
You can create however many notes as you want in that notebook.
There are only basic note types.
Searching is not an MVP feature.
Tags could be included. (scope/feature creep - maybe add after 1st release instead)
More utilitarian UI.
Maybe use an existing material UI library for the initial design.
This is a basic streamlined local note keeping utility with built-in security & encryption features to protect your notes from being accessed without your permission.
